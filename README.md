# guess-mime

`guess-mime` is a Python project that detects the MIME type of a file. It utilizes both the `python-magic` library for more accurate 
detection and the built-in `mimetypes` module as a fallback.

## Features
- Detects MIME type of a given file.
- Uses `python-magic` for reliable MIME type detection.
- Falls back to `mimetypes` if `python-magic` fails.
- Provides a simple command-line interface (CLI).
