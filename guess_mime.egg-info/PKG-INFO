# guess-mime

`guess-mime` is a Python project that detects the MIME type of a file. It utilizes both the `python-magic` library for more accurate detection and the built-in `mimetypes` module as a fallback.

## Features
- Detects MIME type of a given file.
- Uses `python-magic` for reliable MIME type detection.
- Falls back to `mimetypes` if `python-magic` fails.
- Provides a simple command-line interface (CLI).

## Installation

### Install dependencies
To install all required dependencies, create a virtual environment and use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
